# Battleship!

## Technology Stack
 - React
 - TypeScript
 - TailwindCSS
 - Vitest
 - React Router

## Description
A very simple web app, that resembles a BattleShip game.

## Observation
I created the project to practice TypeScript alongside React.
While the struggle was very painful, sometimes even to physical levels(headaches),
it was still very fulfilling to finally complete the code, and see everything work correctly.
The biggest chunk of time spent was taken by the board class and their tests.

## Pages
The project features principal 3 pages:
   + Landing page ("/")
     
     ![Welcome page screenshot](https://github.com/WillAvatec/battleship-react/assets/115133403/7ce66dde-1cb0-4dde-ac18-9f7796cfd9a8)
     
   + Placement menu ("/placement")

   + Main Game ("/game")

## Possible Improvements
- Add sound effects
- Create a better AI
- Add background music
- Display a transition when changing pages
